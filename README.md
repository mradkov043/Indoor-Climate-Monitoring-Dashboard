# Indoor Climate Monitoring Dashboard

## Introduction

The Indoor Climate Monitoring Dashboard is a user-friendly platform designed to monitor  various indoor environmental parameters such as temperature, CO2 levels, and humidity. Tailored specifically for environments that require constant climate control like greenhouses, data centers, and residential spaces, this dashboard provides real-time data visualization to help maintain optimal conditions.

## Technologies

- Node.js and Express for the backend
- TypeScript for type safety and developer productivity
- MySQL for data storage

## 1. Client & Team

**Clients:** Environmental control companies, facility managers, and homeowners looking for precise climate control.
**Team:** Developed by Matey Radkov (Contact: matey20043@gmail.com)
